# ConservativeSentimentAnalysis

The goal of this project is to create an open-source lightweight framework for bulk/batch downloading comment data from subreddits for later analysis.

Currently it is leveraging the powerful pmaw python library, created by Matthew Podolak (https://github.com/mattpodolak/pmaw) as the interface with the Reddit API.

Some additional functionality would require direct API calls with log-in info, but for the purpose of read-only operations the pmaw library is fantastic.
